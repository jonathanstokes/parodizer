# Todo
- ~Remove duplicate songs from search results.~
- Convert rating/scores into an object that can return its number but display the history of how it got there, for better tweaking of results.
- Create an original logo.
- Have the job status include some percentage complete, especially based on the rhyming words being searched through.
- When opening a lyric page, highlight the matching words. (`#:~:text=`)
- button to open the top youtube search result. 
- Integrate with a better rhyming service.
- Get matches within lyrics working server-side.
- Render matches within lyrics.
- for `save`: `Filtered out 'Addicted to Love' by 'Robert Palmer' because no billboard match could be found.` This is listed as `Addicted To Love`, so with only that case difference it should be found.

# Watchlist

# Done
- Edited week `1976-07-10` so that its previous week was `1976-07-04`. It should be `1976-07-03`, but the data for that week was wrong in Billboard.
- Edited `1976-07-04` in `./data/billboard-hot-100.json` to make the previous week `1976-06-26` instead of `1976-06-27`. 
- Edited `1961-12-30`, which should have been correct, to `1961-12-25`, which worked.
- ~Integrate with a better lyric service.~
