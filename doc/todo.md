# Done
- Edited week `1976-07-10` so that its previous week was `1976-07-04`. It should be `1976-07-03`, but the data for that week was wrong in Billboard.
- Edited `1976-07-04` in `./data/billboard-hot-100.json` to make the previous week `1976-06-26` instead of `1976-06-27`. 
- Edited `1961-12-30`, which should have been correct, to `1961-12-25`, which worked.
